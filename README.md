## Visual Design

### The Fonts
I chose the fonts for this webdesign via the [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) website.
I chose these particular fonts because I wanted a elegant and clean look to the fonts so that the focus will go to the specific items sold on the page rather than focusing on the design of the page.

### The Colors

To create the artistic yet simple design I wanted, I choosed to go with earthy colors as all of the products sold on this page is made out of natural materials.

### The Images
insert pictures of the images

I found all of the images on this site on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/).

### The Icons

The icons are taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website.

These are found in the footer for social media links.

The navigation bar is located at the very top of every page, making it easy for the user to navigate back and forth trough the pages.

#### Footer

<br>
The footer is located at the bottom of every page, with links to social media platforms. I want to use a simple design and a fun hover effect so that the user may get interested in visiting the social media links provided.

#### The landing page

<br>
The landing page starts with a simple introduction about the company along with a inspiring image to get the users attention. I also want to highlight a few specific items sold on the page to get the users attention and interest to buy.

#### Product pages

#### Blog
insert image of blog page
<br>
I wanted to add a blog page on this website to uplift the experience for the users, and make them want to stay and hopefully come back to the page. I want the blog to be a inspiration for the users, for those just wanting to see how the process is from clay to finished product, but also for those who wants to get creative and create by them selves.

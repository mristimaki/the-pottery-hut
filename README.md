### Agile Methology
The Agile Methology is used to plan this project, which was implemented through GitHub's Project board. Through the use of the Kanban board I've divided the processes in to a few different sections as follows:
- **To do** (All of the user stories was firstly put in the "To do" section)
- **In progress** (The user stories should bit by bit be moved in to this section when worked on)
- **Done** (And finally should be moved to the "Done" section when the development is completed)

## Visual Design

### The Fonts
I chose the fonts for this webdesign via the [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) website.
I chose these particular fonts because I wanted a elegant and clean look to the fonts so that the focus will go to the specific items sold on the page rather than focusing on the design of the page.

### The Colors
<img width="613" alt="colour-theme-pp5" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/the-pottery-hut/assets/121927123/b174d46b-148b-4bfe-937c-e609eca00730">

To create the artistic yet simple design I wanted, I choosed to go with earthy colors as all of the products sold on this page is made out of natural materials.

### The Images
insert pictures of the images

I found all of the images to this site on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/).

### The Icons

The icons will be taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website. 
<br>
These should be found in the footer for social media links.

## Features

### Page Elements

#### Navigation bar
insert picture of navbar
<br>
The navigation bar is located at the very top of every page, making it easy for the user to navigate back and forth trough the pages.
<hr>

#### Footer
insert image of footer
<br>
The footer is located at the bottom of every page, with links to social media platforms. I want to use a simple design and a fun hover effect so that the user may get interested in visiting the social media links provided.

#### The landing page

(This image is from my wireframes, how I intend for the landing page to look)
<br>
The landing page starts with a simple introduction about the company along with a inspiring image to get the users attention. I also want to highlight a few specific items sold on the page to get the users attention and interest to buy.
<br>
<hr>

#### Product pages
insert image of product page
<br>
I want the product page to be as simple as possible to let the products "shine". 
<br>
<hr>

#### Blog
insert image of blog page
<br>
I wanted to add a blog page on this website to uplift the experience for the users, and make them want to stay and hopefully come back to the page. I want the blog to be a inspiration for the users, for those just wanting to see how the process is from clay to finished product, but also for those who wants to get creative and create by them selves.

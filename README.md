**The Pottery Hut** should be a fictive ceramics-shop for my Project Portfolio 5 with specialisation on e-commerce at Code Institute. Unfortunatley I have not been able to finish or almost even started this project due to personal circomstances (last trimester of pregnancy) and lack of time. I intended to make this e-commerce web application a simple ceramics shop along with a blog, where the users can read more about the process of making all of the items, to why the business is so passionate about working with ceramics and also linking and inviting users to ceramics events/workshops via the blog but first of all via the email subscription.
<br>
This README file is mostly a base for what I want to add to this file, as I have not been able to finish this project and I usually finish my README file when the project is done and deployed. 

## UX

### Site goals

### User goals
**User goals are:**

**The target audience for The Pottery Hut:**

**The Pottery Hut will fill these needs by:**

### Agile Methology
The Agile Methology is used to plan this project, which was implemented through GitHub's Project board. Through the use of the Kanban board I've divided the processes in to a few different sections as follows:
- **To do** (All of the user stories was firstly put in the "To do" section)
- **In progress** (The user stories should bit by bit be moved in to this section when worked on)
- **Done** (And finally should be moved to the "Done" section when the development is completed)

## Tasks
The tasks during the development of this project was somewhat followed by Code Institutes "Boutique Ado" walkthrough project in this particular order:

#### Before project inception
- Designing Wireframes
- Creating reporitory in GitHub
- Creating Project, Epics, User Stories and preparing Kanban board
  
#### Creating the project in Gitpod
- Creating the django project
- Installing Django Allauth
- As I eventually want to customize the allauth templates, I started making copies of them in my own templates/allauth directory. Following along the Boutique Ado Setup.
- Setting up Templates, since I'm going to use Bootstrap I've started my base.html template with the Starter Template from the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template) and made the basic structure for this file.


## Visual Design

### The Fonts
I chose the fonts for this webdesign via the [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) website.
I chose the particular fonts because I wanted a elegant and clean look to the fonts so that the focus will go to the specific items sold on the page rather than focusing on the design of the page.

### The Colors
<img width="613" alt="colour-theme-pp5" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/the-pottery-hut/assets/121927123/b174d46b-148b-4bfe-937c-e609eca00730">
<br>
To create the artistic yet simple design I wanted, I choosed to go with neutral earthy colors as all of the products sold on this page is made out of natural materials, and as stated above, I want the products to stand out rather than focusing on the design of the page.

### The Images

I found all of the images to this site on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/). I will store all of my media files at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ip/gr-sea-gg-brand-home-base?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=goog_selfserve_brand_wk22_replicate_core_branded_keyword&utm_term=1329&campaignid=17601148700&adgroupid=141182782954&keyword=cloudinary&device=c&matchtype=e&adposition=&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp8OpBhAFEiwAG7NaEpuxAQIlB3ADCSNWSqO84mz6ldLXcqLtAOC-fmata45ShySiwssRiRoCXa0QAvD_BwE)

### The Icons

The icons will be taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website. 
<br>
These will be found in the footer for social media links when project is done.

## Features

### Page Elements

#### Navigation bar
<br>
The navigation will be located at the very top of every page, making it easy for the user to navigate back and forth trough the pages.
<hr>

#### Footer
<br>
The footer will be located at the bottom of every page, with links to social media platforms and email contact. I want to use a simple design and a fun hover effect so that the user may get interested in visiting the social media links provided.
<hr>

#### The landing page
<img width="627" alt="landing-page-desktop" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/the-pottery-hut/assets/121927123/6f1d1da6-22cd-499e-9c97-27f243c0fe6e">
<br>

_(This image is from my wireframes, how I intend for the landing page to look)_
<br>
The landing page should start with a simple introduction about the company along with a inspiring image to get the users attention. I also want to highlight a few specific items sold on the page to get the users attention and interest to buy.
<br>
<hr>

#### Product pages

<br>
I want the product page to be as simple as possible to let the products "shine". 
<br>
<hr>

#### Blog

<br>
I wanted to add a blog page on this website to uplift the experience for the users, and make them want to stay and hopefully come back to the page. I want the blog to be a inspiration for the users, for those just wanting to see the process from clay to finished product, but also for those who wants to get creative and create by them selves.
